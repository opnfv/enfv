Introduction
============

The purpose of this Requirements Project is to articulate the capabilities 
and behaviours needed in Edge NFV platforms, and how they interact with 
centralized NFVI and MANO components of NFV solutions.


Problem description
-------------------

Edge NFVI location has certain specific requirements related to:

1. Appropriate Tunneling for User Traffic across WAN (Ethernet, IP/MPLS) links
#. Appropriate Tunneling for Management Traffic across WAN links
#. Including reachability requirements to the compute platform (‘eth0’ resilience)
#. Extending Multi-DC management to address many small "DC" locations
#. Monitoring Capabilities required for a remote Compute Node
#. Squaring Bare Metal with remote survivability and whether IaaS is more appropriate for remote locations

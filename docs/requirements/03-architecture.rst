High level architecture and general features
============================================

Functional overview
-------------------

We foresee two OpenStack deployment models:
 1. Single-cloud. Centralized OpenStack controller and ENFVI nodes are Compute nodes
 2. Multi-cloud. Each NFVI node contains OpenStack controller, thus it becomes an "embedded cloud"
    with single internal compute node

Architecture overview is here.

General Features and Requirements
---------------------------------

This is main part.

High level northbound interface specification
---------------------------------------------

What is northbound here? VIM controller?
